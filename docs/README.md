## What Is It

`panco` is a command-line tool which helps to automate bulk tasks when working with [Palo Alto Networks](https://paloaltonetworks.com) firewalls
and Panorama, which normally would be cumbersome having to do them one-by-one. Features of this tool include:

* Exporting objects from the device - address, service, tag
* Creating address, service and tag objects
* Renaming address, service and tag objects
* Adding or removing objects from address and service groups
* Creating, adding or removing URL entries from a custom URL category
* Tag multiple objects
* Deleting objects
* Exporting a security, NAT, Decryption or Policy-Based Forwarding (PBF) policy
* Creating security, NAT, Decryption or Policy-Based Forwarding (PBF) rules
* Editing security, NAT, Decryption or Policy-Based Forwarding (PBF) rules - e.g. adding a Log Profile to all rules
* Generate CLI set commands from a CSV file used for object actions

> **_NOTE_**: Your account must have API access to the devices in order to use this tool
