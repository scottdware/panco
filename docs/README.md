* Exporting a security, NAT or Policy-Based Forwarding (PBF) policy
* Creating security, NAT or Policy-Based Forwarding (PBF) rules

* Group security or NAT rules by tags
* Move multiple security, NAT or Policy-Based Forwarding (PBF) rules at a time
* Get the hit count data on security, NAT or Policy-Based Forwarding (PBF) rules
